These files are for the participants to use during their hands-on workshop.  I would recommend sending them the text version, as sometimes the single and double quotes are converted to "smart quotes" and will not execute properly.

If you open the file for Pages, be sure to turn off smart quotes first in Preferences.

Send this file to the participants.
